## The base for this code is from Think Java 2nd edition: https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2

## Our mods are as follows:
* Graphics (Wolf, Nate, Valerie)
- Nicer table graphic
- Cool custom cards
- (Display of decks and piles)
- New deck for Uno Game -> may run into copywrite on this.  (create generic version)
- See how many cards are in other's hands (not which cards)

* Game options:
   * We have crazy 8's
   
   * Solitaire (Figuring out how to position cards on a table, making sure cards can be moved around on the table by pointing, clicking, holding, and draging)
   - Create logic for the game (user piles must be red/black alternating, decending in value)
   - draw pile flipped by 3
   - Win all 4 suits king to ace
   - Only kings can go in a blank spot
   - Single player game
   - Anifa & Abduvoris

   * Rummy
   * War - James
   * Black Jack - Noe, Monica
   * thirteen  - Asa, Lylla
  
   * Texas Holdem

   * bs (might have to rename?) 30 second interval to call bs before it moves to next person's turn, a button to make the call instead of verbal or chat. -Cedar
   


Functionality (once we have a working prototype):
   * App 
   * Multiplayer in the app (Firebase)

### Stages
1. Visual Java game with new graphics and lots of options for card games. (Nicole will walk through hello world app, so you know how to make a basic app)
2. Visual Java app with new graphics and lots of options for card games.
