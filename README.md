## The base for this code is from Think Java 2nd edition: https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2

## Our mods are as follows:
* Graphics (Wolf, Nate, Valerie)
- Nicer table graphic
- Cool custom cards
- (Display of decks and piles)
- New deck for Uno Game -> may run into copywrite on this.  (create generic version)
- See how many cards are in other's hands (not which cards)

* Game options:
   * We have crazy 8's
   * Solitaire
   * Uno (work with graphics group)
   * Go fish
   * Rummy
   * War
   * Pokemon (work with graphics group) <- stretch goal (also possible copywrite problems)
   * Black Jack
   * thirteen
   * Texas Holdem
   * poker?
   * call bridge/call break
   * hearts
   * Palace
   * GoldFish
   * bs (might have to rename?) 30 second interval to call bs before it moves to next person's turn, a button to make the call instead of verbal or chat.


Functionality (once we have a working prototype):
   * App 
   * Multiplayer in the app (Firebase)

### Stages
1. Visual Java game with new graphics and lots of options for card games. (Nicole will walk through hello world app, so you know how to make a basic app)
2. Visual Java app with new graphics and lots of options for card games.
3. Muliplayer visual Java app with new graphics and lots of options for card games.
